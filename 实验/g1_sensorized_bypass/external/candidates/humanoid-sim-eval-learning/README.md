# Humanoid Simulation Evaluation
Simulation evaluation framework for the Unitree G1 humanoid robot using MuJoCo. Evaluates a pretrained locomotion policy across terrain types and movement directions, logging episode outcomes for analysis.

---
## What this does
- Runs speed sweep experiments on the G1 across flat, staircase, slope, and uneven terrain
- Tests forward, backward, and lateral movement directions
- Logs episode outcomes (fall / timeout, survival time) to CSV for analysis
- Includes an interactive sandbox for manual auditing

## Stack

- Python ≥ 3.10
- MuJoCo 3.x
- PyTorch (inference only)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- Apple Silicon / Mac — run with `mjpython`

## Usage

```bash
# list available scenes
mjpython run_test.py --list

# run a sweep f,b,l are forward, backward and laterally respectively
mjpython run_test.py --scene flat --direction f 
mjpython run_test.py --scene stairs --direction b

# with viewer
mjpython run_test.py --scene slope2 --direction f --viewer

# sandbox — edit SCENE, VX, DIRECTION at top of file
mjpython sandbox.py
```

## Output

Each run produces one CSV in `results/` named `{scene}_{direction}.csv`:

```
episode_id, commanded_vx, direction, outcome,  survival_time_s
0,          0.2,          forward,   timeout,  10.0
1,          1.4,          forward,   fall,     3.24
```

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and MuJoCo 3.x installed.

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/MichaelNguyenz229/humanoid_learning.git>
   cd humanoid_learning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with uv**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   This creates a `.venv` virtual environment and installs all pinned dependencies from `uv.lock`.

   Robot model, meshes, and pretrained policy are included in `assets/g1/` — no extra downloads needed.
